Basic SQL statements: DDL and DML
In the first part of this tutorial, you’ve seen some of the SQL statements that you need to start building a database. This page gives you a review of those and adds several more that you haven’t seen yet.

SQL statements are divided into two major categories: data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML). Both of these categories contain far more statements than we can present here, and each of the statements is far more complex than we show in this introduction. If you want to master this material, we strongly recommend that you find a SQL reference for your own database software as a supplement to these pages.
